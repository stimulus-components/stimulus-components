If you have Turbo >=8 enabled in your app, you don't need this component because it's now a built-in feature.
::

## Installation

:installation-block{:package="package" :packagePath="packagePath"}

## Usage

::code-block{tabName="app/views/index.html"}

```html
<a href="/about" data-controller="prefetch">About</a>.
```

::

**Note**: To improve performance, links will only be prefetched if they are in the viewport and if the user isn't on a slow connection.

## Extending Controller

import Prefetch from "@stimulus-components/prefetch"

export default class extends Prefetch {

    console.log("Do what you want here.")
  }
}
