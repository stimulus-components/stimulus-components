### Patch Changes

- [#191](https://github.com/stimulus-components/stimulus-components/pull/191) [`ee55aef`](https://github.com/stimulus-components/stimulus-components/commit/ee55aef8d654d93a5e839733bb079e709759f8f1) Thanks [@guillaumebriday](https://github.com/guillaumebriday)! - Packaging: publish only the built `dist/` (via a new `files` allowlist), build automatically before publish with a `prepack` hook, and flag packages as `sideEffects: false` so bundlers can tree-shake them. Also hardens controllers under TypeScript `strict` mode.
